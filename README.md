**🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System**
    An AI-powered attendance management system that uses Face Recognition to automatically mark and manage student attendance. Built with Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Excel
reporting, this project eliminates manual attendance and makes the process fast, accurate, and secure.

 **Key Highlights**
      👤 Face Recognition based attendance (no manual entry)
      🧠 Image preprocessing for better accuracy
      🔐 Admin login system
      📊 Daily & student-wise attendance reports (Excel)
      🌐 Web-based dashboard (Flask)
      📁 JSON-based data storage

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
      Technology	Purpose
      Python	Core programming language
      Flask	Web framework
      OpenCV	Face detection & recognition
      NumPy	Numerical computations
      OpenPyXL	Excel report generation
      HTML/CSS	Frontend UI
      JSON	Data storage

**🚀 How the System Works**
      Admin Login
      Secure login using predefined admin credentials.
      Student Registration
      Students are registered and mapped with face labels.
      Face Recognition
      Webcam captures face images.
      Images are preprocessed (grayscale, histogram equalization, denoising).
      Recognized faces are matched with stored data.
      Attendance Marking
      Attendance is automatically marked with date & time.
      Duplicate entries for the same day are avoided.
      Report Generation
      Daily attendance reports
      Individual student attendance reports
      Reports are exported as Excel (.xlsx) files.
